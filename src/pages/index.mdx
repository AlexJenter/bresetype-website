# Hello!

I’m Alex — a Swiss type designer, font developer, and typographer.

I’ve been working in the world of print, typography, and type design for over two decades.
Over the years, I've developed a deep interest in world scripts, gaining experience in Arabic, Bengali, Cyrillic, Devanagari, Georgian, Greek, Gujarati, Thai, and Vietnamese.
I’ve also built a strong passion for type history and design education, sharing what I know through teaching and workshops at places like ECAL Master Type Design (CH), SFGZ (CH), Winchester School of Art (UK).
Whether it’s beginners or advanced students, I love helping others explore the art and craft of type design.

From 2012 to 2024, I was part of the team at Dalton Maag in London, working as a type designer, font developer, and team manager. I had the chance to help shape the visual identity of global brands like Amazon, DHL, Facebook, FedEx, HP, Nokia, and Oracle — designing custom multi-script typefaces, refining logotypes and wordmarks, and creating bespoke fonts used by millions worldwide in collaboration with agencies and studios of all sizes.

Beyond design work, I planned and led a training program for new junior staff, built internal knowledge systems, and streamlined the font development process.
